    "Problem: given numbers $l_1 ... l_n > 0$, where $l_i$ is length of job, $w_i$ is weight of the job. Find an ordering to minimize total weighted completion time.\n",
    "\n",
    "aka. minimize $w_1 l_1 + w_2(l_1 + l_2) + w_3 (l_1 + l_2 + l_ 3) + ...$\n",

    "Proof of correctness: Assume we have an optimal ordering $(w_i^*, l_i^*)$ such that the total weighted completion time is less than our ordering. Then there is an $1 \\leq i \\leq n$ such that $l_i^* / w_i^* > l_{i+1}^* / w_{i+1}^*$ (otherwise it's the same as our algorithm). Then if we swap $i$ and $i+1$, then the difference between new and old is:\n",

    "$(l_{i+1}^*)(w_{i+1}^*) + (l_i^*+l_{i+1}^*)(w_i^*) - (l_i^*)(w_i^*) - (l_i^*+l_{i+1}^*)(w_{i+1}^*) = (l_{i+1}^*)(w_i^*) - (l_i^*)(w_{i+1}^*) < 0$. This implies we can further improve the \"optimal\" solution. Aka. we can't have an optimal solution for which $l_i^* / w_i^* > l_{i+1}^* / w_{i+1}^*$. But all $n!$ permutations will have this property, except for the permutation generated by our greedy algorithm."
